<b>1. Switch to energy-efficient light bulbs: </b><br>
        Switching to energy-efficient bulbs is an easy way to save shed-loads of electricity. 
        The traditional types – known as incandescent bulbs – only convert 10% of the energy used to power them into light. 
        The rest is lost as heat!

        <b></b> 2. Turn off appliances on standby: <br></b>
        According to the Energy Saving Trust, the average UK household spends £35 a year on appliances left on standby.
        This is because, when you leave devices like TVs or stereos on standby, rather than switching them off, they still
        use power. But there’s an easy solution – turn them off at the mains when you’re not using them! <br>

        <b>3. Be more energy-efficient with your fridge and freezer: <br></b>
        Clean the coils – it might not come top of the list of chores, but the coils at the back of your fridge get dirty
        over time. Wiping them clean can make a big difference in boosting the energy-efficiency of your fridge. According
        to the Consumer Energy Center, doing this could actually lower your fridge’s energy use by as much as 30%. Time to
        get scrubbing!
        Keep them full –  by keeping your fridge and freezer at least three-quarters full, you can make sure that they don’t
        waste energy heating empty air. But remember, don’t cram them too full either – this could stop air from circulating,
        which will also use more energy.
